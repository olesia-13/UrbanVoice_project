# UrbanVoice 

**UrbanVoice** is an Android mobile application that transforms mundane public transport trips into immersive cultural experiences.
By using real-time geolocation, the app automatically plays audio stories about historical landmarks, famous people, and significant events as the passenger passes them on their route.

The project aims to reconnect city residents with their urban environment and make cultural education accessible to everyone during their daily commute.
